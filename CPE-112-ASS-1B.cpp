DATA TYPES IN C - LANGUAGE:
 
 
 
 Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter. C language has some predefined set of data types to handle various kinds of data that we can use in our program. These datatypes have different storage capacities.
 
 
 
 	C language supports 2 different type of data types:
 
 
 
    	1. Primary data types:
 
 		These are fundamental data types in C namely integer(int), floating point(float), character(char) and void.
 
 
 
     	2. Derived data types:
 
 		Derived data types are nothing but primary data types but a little twisted or grouped together like array, stucture, union and pointer. These are discussed in details later.
 
 
 
 Data type determines the type of data a variable will hold. If a variable x is declared as int. it means x can hold only integer values. Every variable which is used in the program must be declared as what data-type it is.
 
 
 
 PRIMARY DATA TYPES IN C:
 
 	1. Integer Type:
 
 		Integers are used to store whole numbers.
 
 
 
 		Size and range of Integer type on 16-bit machine:
 
 			Type:				Size(bytes):		Range:
 
 			int or signed int			2			-32,768 to 32767
 
 			unsigned int			2			0 to 65535
 
 			short int or signed short int		1			-128 to 127
 
 			unsigned short int			1			0 to 255
 
 			long int or signed long int		4			-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
 
 			unsigned long int			4			0 to 4,294,967,295
 
 
 
 
 
 	2. Floating Point Type:
 
 		Floating types are used to store real numbers.
 
 
 
 		Size and range of Integer type on 16-bit machine
 
 			Type		Size(bytes)	Range
 
 			Float		4		3.4E-38 to 3.4E+38
 
 			double		8		1.7E-308 to 1.7E+308
 
 			long double	10		3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932
 
 
 
 
 
 	3. Character Type:
 
 		Character types are used to store characters value.
 
 
 
 		Size and range of Integer type on 16-bit machine
 
 			Type			Size(bytes)		Range
 
 			char or signed char		1			-128 to 127
 
 			unsigned char		1			0 to 255
 
 
 
 
 
 	4. Void Type
 
 		Void type means no value. This is usually used to specify the type of functions which returns nothing. We will get acquainted to this datatype as we start learning more advanced topics in C language, like functions, pointers etc.
 
 
 
 
 
 DATA TYPES IN C++ - LANGUAGE:
 
 
 
 - Data types define the type of data a variable can hold, for example an integer variable can hold integer data, a character type variable can hold character data etc.
 
 - Data types in C++ are categorised in three groups: Built-in, user-defined and Derived.
 
 
 
 	1. Built in Data Types
 
 
 
 		char: For characters. Size 1 byte.
 
 			char ch = 'A';
 
 
 
 		int: For integers. Size 2 bytes.
 
 			int num = 100;
 
 
 
 		float: For single precision floating point. Size 4 bytes.
 
 			float num = 123.78987;
 
 
 
 		double: For double precision floating point. Size 8 bytes.
 
 			double num = 10098.98899;
 
 
 
 		bool: For booleans, true or false.
 
 			bool b = true;
 
 
 
 		wchar_t: Wide Character. This should be avoided because its size is implementation defined and not reliable.
 
 
 
 
 
 	2. User-defined Data Types
 
 
 
 		We have three types of user-defined data types in C++
 
  			1. struct
 
 			2. union
 
 			3. enum
 
 
 
 	3. Derived Data Types
 
 
 
 		We have three types of derived-defined data types in C++
 
 			1. Array
 
 			2. Function
 
 			3. Pointer
